# Code-along Demo

This is the directory in which the trainer will write the demo application during session 3 of the "Introduction to Go" training.

To find the application which was written during your session, please check out the appropriate branch in this repository.

The branch name will have this format: `${SESSION yyyyMM}_demo_application`

So, for example, the branch for the May 2021 session will be named: `202105_demo_application`.
